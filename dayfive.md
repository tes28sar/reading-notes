# **What is CSS** 

                CSS allows you to add  colors  decorations to your website. Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting 

                your markup using whatever design you like. 

                CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the  

                    * **color** 
   

                    * **size**  
 

                     * **animation**  
 

 

CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your 

web page.   

 

CSS code example 
 

Body { 

          Background-color:  blue; 

          Margin: 1; 

} 

  

_CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified_ 

 

        # **Specifications** 

                         _All web standards technologies  like HTML,   JavaScript, etc  are defined in giant documents called specifications  or  > specs, which are published by standards organizations  such as _ 

            *W3C, 

            *WHATWG, 

            *ECMA, 

            *Khronos) 

 

These standard organizations define  precisely how these technologies are supposed to behave, and CSS is no different, it is developed by a group within the W3C called the **CSS Working Group**  

            ### CSS and Browser support and compatibility        

_As new features of CSS   are implemented, it is important  to       check browser  support and browser compatibility  across the board_
